  You're a hacker, and you've bought all the passwords for several different users. Use the "Password Bank" on the left,
  and guess the correct password for each user on different sites. Knowing that many people use the same passwords for 
  multiple accounts, try using the same passwords! You'll start off by hacking Doris McGrandma, a new - and unexperienced -
   computer user.
