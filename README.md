24HoursOfGood
=============

Developed at Google Ann Arbor for the 24 Hours of Good hackathon, hosted by Google Security.

This is a flash based game designed to show why it is dangerous to share passwords across different sites on the internet. It showcases how a hacker can gain access to multiple accounts much more easily if you only use one password, as opposed to using multiple passwords across different accounts.

All content is on the 'gh-pages' branch.
